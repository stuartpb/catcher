Microscopic Node error helpers

## Oh hey, this thing!

This was going to be my first published NPM package. (I might have actually published it, now that I think of it.)

The idea was not unlike the `.catch` part of Promises, meant for a world where Nodebacks were the lingua franca of async.

Now that we all just do our async with Promises, it's kind of pointless. (Also, having moved to Promises myself, I now get that this error handling stuff is the main reason why Nodebacks aren't really a good standard convention.)
